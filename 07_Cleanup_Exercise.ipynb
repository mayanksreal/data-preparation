Platforms like Netflix and IMDb continuously accumulate vast amounts of data about movies and TV shows — from audience ratings and genres to release years, runtimes, and popularity trends. Hidden within this data are powerful insights about viewer preferences, industry patterns, and the evolution of entertainment over time.\n",

        "As the volume of entertainment data grows, so does the importance of Data Science in transforming raw information into meaningful stories. Drawing from disciplines such as statistics, programming, and domain knowledge in media analytics, Data Science allows us to clean, structure, analyze, and interpret complex datasets in a way that supports informed decision-making.\n",
